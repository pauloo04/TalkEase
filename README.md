## About

TalkEase solves the communication challenges faced by dyslexic individuals. Dyslexia is a common learning disorder that affects reading, writing, and language processing skills. Individuals with dyslexia often struggle with complex sentences, comprehending lengthy texts, forming grammatically correct sentences, and expressing themselves fluently. These challenges can lead to feelings of frustration, reduced academic performance, limited professional opportunities, and social barriers.

The app simplifies sentences, making complex language more understandable and easier to comprehend. It utilizes ChatGPT to break down intricate sentences into simpler forms, empowering dyslexic individuals to grasp information with clarity.

TalkEase also provides a summarization feature, utilizing ChatGPT to condense lengthy texts into concise and meaningful summaries. This allows users to efficiently extract key information and navigate through complex content.

For sentence formation, TalkEase offers suggestions, prompts, and guidance, helping dyslexic individuals construct grammatically correct and well-structured sentences. The app's use of ChatGPT assists users in expressing themselves accurately and eloquently.
